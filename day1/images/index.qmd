## Starting point

> A 10X engineer is one who can bring together ten other engineers and emerge with a shared understanding and rough consensus of the problem being solved and work that needs to be done.

> In this house we call them "project managers".

## Research software

- Software is created and run to answer a question
- Papers, theses, and other reports are the product
- The software is "just" a tool
- Shades into projects that produce software for other researchers to use

---

## You

- Degree(s) in some research domain
- Little or no formal training in software development
- In a team of 1–12 people
- Timelines of weeks to months

## Me

- Don't remember much statistics…
- …but I've built a lot of complicated software…
- …and I've been lucky enough to hang out with some very smart people
