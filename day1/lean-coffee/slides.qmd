**Time:** TBD (Afternoon session)  
**Format:** Lean Coffee methodology

## What is Lean Coffee?

Lean Coffee is a structured, but agenda-less meeting format. Participants gather, build an agenda, and begin conversing. Conversations are directed and productive because the agenda for the meeting was democratically generated.

## How It Works

### 1. Setup (5 minutes)

Three columns are created:

- **To Discuss:** Topics waiting to be discussed
- **Discussing:** Current topic
- **Discussed:** Completed topics

### 2. Generate Topics (5-10 minutes)

Everyone writes topics on sticky notes:

- One topic per note
- Brief, clear descriptions
- Questions, concerns, or ideas
- Related to openwashdata

### 3. Vote on Topics (5 minutes)

Democratic prioritization:

- Each person gets 2-3 votes
- Vote for topics of interest
- Can use multiple votes on one topic
- Topics ranked by vote count

### 4. Discuss Topics (45-60 minutes)

Structured conversations:

- Start with highest-voted topic
- Set timer for 5 minutes
- When timer ends, vote to continue or move on
- If continuing, add 3 more minutes
- Move completed topics to "Discussed"

### 5. Close and Actions (5 minutes)

Wrap up the session:

- Summarize key insights
- Identify action items
- Assign owners to actions
- Share notes with group
