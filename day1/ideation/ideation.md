# Hackathon Ideas for Day 2

## Data Package & Analysis Ideas

- **Historical Data Digitization**: Digitize scanned historical records/papers, add images to folder, have Claude read and analyze the data
- **Open Wash Data Package Workflow**: Clone an existing package, use Claude to write an article in the vignette folder using the data, add your own notes and templates

## Branding & Design

- **Create Brand Guidelines**: Develop comprehensive branding for all openwashdata projects including:
  - Color palettes (with colorblindness considerations)
  - Common design elements for packages, websites, and marketing materials
  - Brand YAML/package YAML templates
  - Implementation across all data packages via pull requests

## Data Discovery & Documentation

- **Identify New Data Sources**: Find additional WASH data sources and create data packages for them
- **Review Course Materials**: Prepare command lists for reviewing module content and assignments for next iteration of data science course
- **SFD Report Analysis**: 
  - Collect all SFD PDF reports into a folder
  - Use Claude to review reports and categorize data sources as primary or secondary
  - For primary data sources, analyze methods used (key informant interviews, FGDs, observations, lab analysis, etc.)
- **SFD Data Validation**:
  - Collect all SFD JSON files
  - Cross-check and verify how many data points contain actual data vs placeholders
  
## Project management

- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Prepare contribution guidelines for the project
- **GitHub Project Management**: Organize issues into a GitHub project kanban board

## Teaching & Assessment Tools

- **Assignment Templates**: Create templates for responding to student assignments, implement as slash commands
- **Document Conversion**: Transform existing Word reports into Quarto slides
- **Grading Rubrics**: Develop grading rubrics for courses, test on previous student assignments using Claude
- **Git-based Submissions**: Implement workflow for students to submit assignments via Git/GitHub instead of Google Docs/email

## Content Creation & Conversion

- **Talk Transcription**: Find talks you like, have Claude transcribe them and convert to slides
- **CV Updates**: Update existing CVs and have Claude create Quarto document versions
- **Mentorship Program Page**: Generate page featuring mentor/mentee profiles with clickable elements linking to their work

## "Hubris to Hope" or any other course Ideas

- **Git/GitHub/Quarto Training**: Provide 2-hour basic introduction for students on using these tools for essay writing
- **Quarto Assignment Requirements**: Expect and require students to submit assignments written in Quarto
- **Automated Grading**: Define grading rubrics and run Claude Code to evaluate student assignments
