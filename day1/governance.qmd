## Session Overview {.smaller}

**Time:** 14:00-15:00  
**Format:** Interactive discussion with presentations

Today we'll explore governance models for open research software communities, drawing from best practices and adapting them to openwashdata's needs.

## Why Governance Matters

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Without Good Governance:**

- Low productivity
- Opaque decision-making
- Unclear leadership
- Frustration and conflicts
- Difficulty scaling
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**With Good Governance:**

- Clear processes
- Transparent decisions
- Defined roles
- Sustainable growth
- Community trust
:::

::::

## Governance Evolution Stages

::: {.incremental}
1. **Early Stage** (1-3 people)
   - "Just do it" approach
   - Minimal formal process
   - Direct communication

2. **Growing Stage** (4-8 people)
   - Need for coordination
   - Emerging documentation
   - Basic collaboration tools

3. **Mature Stage** (9+ people)
   - Formal decision-making
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Structured contribution process

## Where is openwashdata Today?

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Current State:**
- Growing community
- Multiple contributors
- Various projects
- Informal coordination
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Next Steps:**
- Define governance model
- Document processes
- Clarify roles
- Establish standards
:::

### Reflection Exercise (5 min)
Think about: Where do you see openwashdata in this evolution?

## Common Governance Models

::: {.incremental}
- **Benevolent Dictator**
  - Single leader makes final decisions
  - Common in early projects
  
- **Elected Representatives**
  - Community elects leaders
  - Fixed terms and rotation
  
- **Consensus-Based**
  - All members have equal say
  - Decisions by agreement
  
- **Hybrid Models**
  - Combine elements
  - Adapt to community needs
:::

## Decision-Making: Martha's Rules {.smaller}

A lightweight framework for inclusive decision-making:

1. **Proposal Submission**
   - Anyone can propose
   - Written in advance
   - Clear and specific

2. **Preliminary Vote**
   - Thumbs up: Agree
   - Thumbs sideways: Discuss more
   - Thumbs down: Serious concerns

3. **Discussion & Revision**
   - Address concerns
   - Modify proposal

4. **Final Vote**
   - Clear majority needed
   - Document decision

---

## Key Governance Components

### 1. Roles & Responsibilities

::: {.incremental}
- **Maintainers**: Technical decisions, code review
- **Contributors**: Submit data, code, documentation
- **Stewards**: Community management, outreach
- **Users**: Feedback, bug reports
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Question:** What roles do we need in openwashdata?

### 2. Communication Channels

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Internal:**
- Slack/Discord
- Regular meetings
- Email lists
- GitHub discussions

### 3. Documentation

Essential documents for any open community:

::: {.incremental}
- **README**: Project overview
- **CONTRIBUTING**: How to participate
- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT**: Community standards
- **LICENSE**: Legal framework
- **GOVERNANCE**: Decision processes
:::

---

## Community Standards

### Code of Conduct Essentials

::: {.incremental}
- **Clear expectations** for behavior
- **Specific examples** of unacceptable conduct
- **Enforcement mechanisms** that are fair
- **Reporting process** that is safe
- **Consequences** that are proportionate
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Remember:** A code without enforcement is just decoration

## Interactive Exercise: Governance Assessment {.smaller}

**15 minutes - Small Groups**

Discuss and answer:

1. **Who are our users?** How do they find us?
2. **How do we make decisions** currently?
3. **What gets in the way** of contributions?
4. **How do we handle conflicts?**
5. **How do we welcome newcomers?**
6. **What could we automate?**

::: {.fragment}
**Share:** Each group presents one key insight
:::

---

## Proposed Governance Framework

Based on best practices and community needs:

::: {.incremental}
1. **Steering Committee** (3-5 members, rotating)
2. **Working Groups** (data quality, tools, outreach)
3. **Decision Process** (Martha's Rules for major decisions)
4. **Documentation** (all five essential documents)
5. **Regular Reviews** (quarterly governance check-ins)
:::

---

## Action Planning

### Immediate Actions (Next 30 days)

::: {.incremental}
- Draft CODE_OF_CONDUCT
- Create CONTRIBUTING guide
- Define initial roles
- Set up communication channels
:::

### Medium-term (3-6 months)

::: {.incremental}
- Implement decision process
- Form working groups
- Regular community calls
- Document all processes
:::

---

## Small Group Discussion (20 min)

Break into groups of 3-4 to discuss:

1. **Which governance model** fits openwashdata best?
2. **What roles** do we need to define first?
3. **What decisions** need a formal process?
4. **How do we ensure** inclusive participation?

::: {.fragment}
**Report Back:** Each group shares top priority

::: {.incremental}
- Governance enables growth
- Start simple, evolve as needed
- Document everything
- Be inclusive by design
- Review and adapt regularly
