# Workflow - Get started

1. Think of a name for your project
    - naming convention: all small letters, use dashes between words (unless it's an R package), max three words
2. Create a new repository in: github.com/openwashdata-conf
3. Clone the repository to your `gitrepos` folder
4. Open your Terminal on the project folder or navigate to it in your Terminal
5. In parallel, open the project folder in your preferred IDE (e.g., RStudio, VSCode)

# Workflow - Start Claude

1. In the Terminal has its working directory on the project folder, type `claude` and press Enter
2. Claude will start in the Terminal, and you can interact with it
3. Every time, after Claude has created something, you use the command `> commit & push` to save your work
  - the first time you use this command, Claude will ask you to authorize access to your GitHub account

# Workflow - Provide context

1. Add files to your folder that are relevant for your project or could help Claude learn about your context:
   - `data.csv` downloaded from the web or exported from a Google Sheet on our Drive
   - `report.pdf` PDFs you want to work with 
   - `bibliograph.bib` file for your references
   - `*.docx, *.xlsx, *.pptx` etc. (Claude converts everything to `.md`) files that you want to use as context
   - any other files that are relevant for your project
2. Use your IDE to create a new file inside your folder and name it: `initial-prompt.md`
3. In `initial-prompt.md`, write a detailed prompt for Claude to start with. Include links to websites and tell Claude what you need from them. Add YouTube Video links (Claude can also transcribe them). 

# Workflow - Start creating

```
> Use @initial-prompt.md and make a plan for this project. Run it by me. Think hard.
```

# Workflow - Accept permission

Claude will ask for permission when accessing files:

**Always allow** 
- Speeds up workflow
- Often my default choice
- Hard to know trusted operations

**Allow once**
- Good for testing
- A more cautious approach

**Deny**
- Stop the operation
- Reconsider approach

# Workflow - CLAUDE.md

1. After working some time, create the CLAUDE.md using the slash command `/init`
2. Review it. Add things. Adapt things.

# Workflow - Review & Refine

- Review Claude's work in your IDE (use the diff tool to see changes)
- Edit files yourself as needed
- Run Claude again for improvements
- Run through a file, add `TODO: ` comments for Claude to address and then tell Claude to:

```
> Work on the TODOs that I have outlined for your in @slides.qmd
```

# Workflow - README.md

If you:

- have had enough of that project (any time from minutes to hours) and you want to do something else
- think it's "finished" and you want to do something else
- don't even like it

```bash
> create a README.md of this project. do not focus on how to run, install, or deploy the software in here. Provide a high level summary of what I wanted to achieve and what I have done so far. Add the directory tree of the project folder.
```
