"Ice cream, now!" - Embracing AI as Scientists in an inclusive way

We have just concluded a 3-day conference that was a part of our openwashdata conference. Day 2 was dedicated to Claude Code assisted hackathon for which we not only invited the project team members, but the entire Global Health Engineering team. In the end, we were 12 participants. 6 openwashdata members, 5 GHE team members, and an openwashdata alumni, because we love to invite our alumnis.

As a interdisciplinary group with backgrounds in Economics, Environmental Engineering, Biology, Social Sciences, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, Physics, and more, we embrace the use of AI. We recommend our students to use it in their assignments and exams (also the coding exams), we host regular half day events during which we introduce new tools to each other, and we talk quite a lot about potential implications.

When I discovered Claude Code on the 30th May 2025, I lifted off my chair. I got so much work done in the first four hours that I not only had time for an ice cream, but actually really needed to see my team members to talk to them about this. It was the first time that AI completely disrupted my workflows in a way that I could see what I read about when people talk about the implications it will have.

So, we decided to give every a month on Claude Max subscription at 100 CHF to explore and use it together during our conference. Everyone was invited and we were a diverse group. At the beginning of the day, we did a 1:1 check-in and asked people to share their expectations and fears for the day with another person. We identified that people are nervous about the cost, that people are nervous about how intimidating it might feel.

We had regular breaks and worked on reflections in a shared Google Doc. At the end of the day, we concluded with a around of everyone showing what they created. 5 minutes per person. What we build:

- A conversion of DOCX to LaTeX for editing in Overleaf
- A conversion of LaTeX to markdown for sharing in a web native format
- Slash commands for reviews of R data packages
- A conversion of scientific papers into slides
- A quiz from a research proposal and a set of slides
- Dashboards and interactive data applications
- A grading agent for a class with essays. A grading comparison analysis between the agent's and our own grades.
- ...

The discussions were short, yet brought up a lot of material for further conversations:

- What about the experience you take away from people learning to grade exams that now could be done by an AI?
- How would you verify, cross-check and test that the text and numbers on your slides are identical to the content of the scientific manuscripts?
- How much context does Claude Code add from the it's LLMs itself when working on content? Is it possible to tell CLaude Code to not do that at all
- How did it treat placeholds for credentials and API keys in the GitHub Actions it has drafted. Did it use best practices for security?

The conversations continued and on Day 3. One of the key points we have noted from this experience is that it has brought our team closer together, because we all used the same tool. We all looked at a Terminal. We all used plain language prompts to instruct Claude Code to do something for us. And we realized that this brought us closer together. In teams, where those that are already highly proficient in programming tools may benefit the most (at first sight) there is a danger that those less proficicient in computational tools not only feel left out or left behind, but get demorilized because it appears like only a few get to be more productive. 

A last point that has been bugging me is the challenge to use the potential extra time that I would have available because I can get significantly more done, to not do even more, but rather engage in activities that keep my brain active and learning, so I don't lose my mind when strange studies come out that claim my brain isn't working anymore because I used AI.

How do you approach this new wave of tools in your teams?
