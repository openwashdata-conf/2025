subtitle: "From Ideas to Action Plans"

**Time:** 10:45-11:15  
**Format:** Team planning session

## Session Overview

Transform yesterday's ideas into concrete hackathon projects. This session helps teams finalize their project scopes and create actionable development plans.

## Project Planning Framework

### 1. Define the Problem (5 minutes)

**Answer these questions:**

- What specific problem are we solving?
- Who will benefit from our solution?
- What's the current pain point?
- How will we measure success?

**Example:**
> "Field workers struggle to validate water quality data in real-time, leading to errors that are discovered weeks later during analysis."

### 2. Scope the Solution (10 minutes)

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP):**

- Core functionality only
- What can we demo by 15:30?
- What would make this "working"?
- What can we skip for now?

**Nice-to-have features:**

- List for future development
- Prioritize by impact
- Document for showcase

### 3. Technical Planning (10 minutes)

**Architecture decisions:**

- Programming language(s)
- Key libraries/frameworks
- Data sources needed
- Output format

**Task breakdown:**

1. Setup and configuration
2. Core functionality
3. User interface (if applicable)
4. Testing and validation
5. Documentation

### 4. Team Roles (5 minutes)

**Assign responsibilities:**

- **Lead Developer:** Core logic implementation
- **UI/UX Developer:** Interface and user experience
- **Data Wrangler:** Sample data and testing
- **Documentation:** README and demo prep
- **Project Manager:** Timeline and coordination

*Note: Roles can overlap in small teams*

## Project Templates

### Data Processing Tool

```markdown
**Problem:** [Specific data challenge]
**Solution:** Script/tool that [processes/validates/transforms] data
**Input:** [Data format/source]
**Output:** [Cleaned/processed data format]
**Tech Stack:** Python/R + relevant libraries
```

### Visualization Dashboard

```markdown
**Problem:** [What insights are hidden?]
**Solution:** Interactive dashboard showing [metrics/trends]
**Data Source:** [openwashdata API/CSV files]
**Features:** [Charts/filters/exports]
**Tech Stack:** JavaScript/Python + visualization library
```

### API/Integration

```markdown
**Problem:** [Integration/access challenge]
**Solution:** API that [connects/serves/processes]
**Endpoints:** [List key endpoints]
**Authentication:** [Method if needed]
**Tech Stack:** FastAPI/Express + database
```

## GitHub Repository Setup

Create your team repository:

```bash
# Navigate to your gitrepos folder
cd ~/gitrepos

# Create and enter project directory
mkdir openwashdata-[project-name]
cd openwashdata-[project-name]

# Initialize Git repository
git init

# Create initial README
echo "# [Project Name]" > README.md
echo "" >> README.md
echo "## Problem Statement" >> README.md
echo "[Your problem description]" >> README.md
echo "" >> README.md
echo "## Solution" >> README.md
echo "[Your solution approach]" >> README.md
echo "" >> README.md
echo "## Team" >> README.md
echo "- Member 1: Role" >> README.md
echo "- Member 2: Role" >> README.md

# Initial commit
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit: Project setup"
```

## Success Criteria

By the end of this session, each team should have:

1. ✅ Clear problem statement
2. ✅ Defined MVP scope
3. ✅ Technical approach decided
4. ✅ Tasks assigned to team members
5. ✅ GitHub repository created
6. ✅ README with project overview

## Tips for Success

- **Start small:** Better to have a working simple solution than an incomplete complex one
- **Use existing data:** Don't spend time creating test data - use openwashdata resources
- **Leverage Claude Code:** Use AI assistance for boilerplate and complex algorithms
- **Communicate constantly:** Regular check-ins prevent duplicate work
- **Document as you go:** Update README throughout the day

## Ready to Start Hacking?

Once planning is complete:

1. Share your repository link in Slack
2. Post your problem statement
3. Start with setup and configuration
4. Begin implementing core features
5. Check in with mentors early and often
