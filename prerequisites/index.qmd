### 2. Verify Terminal Access

You'll need to use the terminal/command line during the hackathon.

::: {.panel-tabset}
## macOS

1. Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight
2. Type "Terminal" and press Enter
3. You should see a window with a command prompt
4. Type `echo "Terminal works!"` and press Enter
5. If you see "Terminal works!" printed, you're all set

## Windows

**Recommended: Windows Terminal**

1. Install Windows Terminal from the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/terminal)
2. Once installed, press `Win` key and type "Windows Terminal"
3. Click to open Windows Terminal

### 3. Install Python

Python is required for many data processing tasks.

::: {.panel-tabset}
## macOS

1. Check if Python is installed:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

2. If not installed, install using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   # Install Homebrew first if you don't have it
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   
   # Then install Python
   brew install python
   ```

3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   pip3 --version
   ```

## Windows

1. Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Run the installer
3. **Important:** Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
4. Open a new command prompt and verify:
   ```cmd
   python --version
   pip --version
   ```
:::

### 4. GitHub Account Setup

Ensure you can access your GitHub account:

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Log in to your account (or create one if needed)
3. Verify you can access your profile and repositories
4. **Recommended:** Set up [two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa)

### 5. Create Local Working Directory

Create a dedicated folder for storing code repositories locally (not in cloud-synced folders).

::: {.panel-tabset}
## macOS

```bash
# Create the directory in Documents
mkdir -p ~/Documents/gitrepos

# Navigate to it
cd ~/Documents/gitrepos

# Verify it exists
pwd
```

You should see: `/Users/yourusername/Documents/gitrepos`

## Windows

```cmd
# Create the directory in Documents
mkdir %USERPROFILE%\Documents\gitrepos

# Navigate to it
cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents\gitrepos

# Verify it exists
cd
```

You should see: `C:\Users\yourusername\Documents\gitrepos`
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## Important: Avoid Cloud-Synced Folders
Do **not** create your `gitrepos` folder inside:
- OneDrive
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- iCloud Drive

These services can interfere with Git operations.

1. Check your email for the invitation
2. Click the invitation link
3. Accept the invitation to join the organization
