Here’s the code and error message. How can I fix it?”\nCode Improvement: &gt; “Refactor this data processing code to be more efficient and add error handling for missing values.”\nDocumentation: &gt; “Generate comprehensive docstrings for these functions and create a usage example for the README.”\n\n\n\nDevelopment Workflow\n\nSession 1: Foundation (11:15-12:30)\nGoals: - Environment setup complete - Core data structures defined - Basic functionality working - Initial tests passing\nChecklist: - [ ] Dependencies installed - [ ] Project structure created - [ ] Core modules outlined - [ ] Sample data loaded - [ ] First function working\n\n\nSession 2: Features (13:30-15:00)\nGoals: - Main features implemented - User interface functional - Data flow complete - Error handling added\nChecklist: - [ ] Key features working - [ ] Input/output verified - [ ] Basic UI complete - [ ] Edge cases handled - [ ] Integration tested\n\n\nSession 3: Polish (15:00-15:30)\nGoals: - Documentation complete - Demo prepared - Code cleaned up - Repository organized\nChecklist: - [ ] README updated - [ ] Usage examples added - [ ] Code commented - [ ] Demo script ready - [ ] Presentation planned",

Get Claude Code Max Plan\nClaude Code requires a subscription to the Max plan for full functionality.\n\nVisit Claude.ai\nSign up or log in to your account\nSubscribe to the Claude Max plan ($20/month)\nDownload and install Claude Code following the instructions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can cancel the subscription after the conference if you don’t wish to continue using it.\n\n\n\n\n2. Verify Terminal Access\nYou’ll need to use the terminal/command line during the hackathon.\n\nmacOSWindows\n\n\n\nPress Cmd + Space to open Spotlight\nType “Terminal” and press Enter\nYou should see a window with a command prompt\nType echo \"Terminal works!\" and press Enter\nIf you see “Terminal works!” printed, you’re all set\n\n\n\n\nPress Win + R to open Run dialog\nType “cmd” and press Enter (or use PowerShell)\nYou should see a command prompt window\nType echo Terminal works! and press Enter\nIf you see “Terminal works!” printed, you’re all set\n\nAlternative: Consider installing Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store for a better experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Install Python\nPython is required for many data processing tasks.\n\nmacOSWindows\n\n\n\nCheck if Python is installed:\npython3 --version\nIf not installed, install using Homebrew:\n# Install Homebrew first if you don't have it\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\n# Then install Python\nbrew install python\nVerify installation:\npython3 --version\npip3 --version\n\n\n\n\nDownload Python from python.org\nRun the installer\nImportant: Check “Add Python to PATH” during installation\nOpen a new command prompt and verify:\npython --version\npip --version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. GitHub Account Setup\nEnsure you can access your GitHub account:\n\nGo to github.com\nLog in to your account (or create one if needed)\nVerify you can access your profile and repositories\nRecommended: Set up two-factor authentication\n\n\n\n5. Create Local Working Directory\nCreate a dedicated folder for storing code repositories locally (not in cloud-synced folders).\n\nmacOSWindows\n\n\n# Create the directory\nmkdir -p ~/gitrepos\n\n# Navigate to it\ncd ~/gitrepos\n\n# Verify it exists\npwd\nYou should see: /Users/yourusername/gitrepos\n\n\n# Create the directory\nmkdir C:\\gitrepos\n\n# Navigate to it\ncd C:\\gitrepos\n\n# Verify it exists\ncd\nYou should see: C:\\gitrepos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant: Avoid Cloud-Synced Folders\n\n\n\nDo not create your gitrepos folder inside: - OneDrive - Google Drive - Dropbox - iCloud Drive\nThese services can interfere with Git operations.\n\n\n\n\n6. Accept GitHub Organization Invitation\nBefore the conference, you’ll receive an invitation to join the openwashdata-conf GitHub organization.\n\nCheck your email for the invitation\nClick the invitation link\nAccept the invitation to join the organization\nVerify access at: github.com/openwashdata-conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t received an invitation by July 10, please contact the organizing team.",
