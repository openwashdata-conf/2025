    "text": "Required Setup Steps\n\n1. Get Claude Code Max Plan\nClaude Code requires a subscription to the Max plan for full functionality.\n\nVisit Claude.ai\nSign up or log in to your account\nImportant: You must create an individual account (not a collaborative/team account)\nSubscribe to the Claude Max plan ($100/month)\nSend your invoice to Lars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can cancel the subscription after the conference if you don’t wish to continue using it. You will have access to it for 1 month.\n\n\n\n\n2. Verify Terminal Access\nYou’ll need to use the terminal/command line during the hackathon.\n\nmacOSWindows\n\n\n\nPress Cmd + Space to open Spotlight\nType “Terminal” and press Enter\nYou should see a window with a command prompt\nType echo \"Terminal works!\" and press Enter\nIf you see “Terminal works!” printed, you’re all set\n\n\n\nRecommended: Windows Terminal\n\nInstall Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store\nOnce installed, press Win key and type “Windows Terminal”\nClick to open Windows Terminal\nIn the terminal, type echo Terminal works! and press Enter\nIf you see “Terminal works!” printed, you’re all set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Install Node.js\nNode.js is required for many modern web development tools and Claude Code extensions.\n\nmacOSWindows\n\n\n\nCheck if Node.js is already installed:\nnode --version\nIf not installed, install using Homebrew:\n# Install Homebrew first if you don't have it\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\n# Then install Node.js\nbrew install node\nVerify installation:\nnode --version\nnpm --version\n\n\n\n\nDownload Node.js from nodejs.org\nChoose the LTS version (recommended)\nRun the installer\nImportant: Keep all default settings, including “Add to PATH”\nOpen a new Command Prompt and verify:\nnode --version\nnpm --version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Install Claude Code\nClaude Code is the AI coding assistant we’ll use throughout the hackathon.\n\nmacOSWindows\n\n\n\nOpen Terminal\nInstall Claude Code using npm (Node.js must be installed first):\nnpm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code\nImportant: Do NOT use sudo with this command\nAfter installation, verify by running:\nclaude doctor\nYou should see a successful setup confirmation\n\n\n\nClaude Code on Windows requires Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Due to the complexity of the Windows setup, please follow the comprehensive installation guide:\nComplete Windows Installation Guide for Claude Code\nThis guide includes: - Detailed WSL setup instructions - Node.js installation in WSL - Claude Code installation and configuration - Troubleshooting common Windows-specific issues - Tips for optimal performance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Setup Requirements\n\n\n\n\nWindows 10 (version 2004+) or Windows 11\nAdministrator access\nApproximately 30-45 minutes for complete setup\nAfter installation, you’ll launch Claude Code using: wsl claude from your Documents folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Install Python\nPython is required for many data processing tasks.\n\nmacOSWindows\n\n\n\nCheck if Python is installed:\npython3 --version\nIf not installed, install using Homebrew:\n# Install Homebrew first if you don't have it\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\n# Then install Python\nbrew install python\nVerify installation:\npython3 --version\npip3 --version\n\n\n\n\nDownload Python from python.org\nRun the installer\nImportant: Check “Add Python to PATH” during installation\nOpen a new command prompt and verify:\npython --version\npip --version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. GitHub Account Setup\nEnsure you can access your GitHub account:\n\nGo to github.com\nLog in to your account\nVerify you can access your profile and repositories\nRecommended: Set up two-factor authentication\n\n\n\n7. Create Local Working Directory\nCreate a dedicated folder for storing code repositories locally (not in cloud-synced folders). The recommended location is in your Documents folder, named gitrepos. Use your preferred way of creating directories (Finder, File Explorer, or terminal/command line).\nBelow are the terminal commands for both macOS and Windows users.\n\nmacOSWindows\n\n\n# Create the directory in Documents\nmkdir -p ~/Documents/gitrepos\n\n# Navigate to it\ncd ~/Documents/gitrepos\n\n# Verify it exists\npwd\nYou should see: /Users/yourusername/Documents/gitrepos\n\n\n# Create the directory in Documents\nmkdir %USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\gitrepos\n\n# Navigate to it\ncd %USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\gitrepos\n\n# Verify it exists\ncd\nYou should see: C:\\Users\\yourusername\\Documents\\gitrepos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant: Avoid Cloud-Synced Folders\n\n\n\nDo not create your gitrepos folder inside:\n\nOneDrive\nGoogle Drive\nDropbox\niCloud Drive\n\nThese services can interfere with Git operations.\n\n\n\n\n8. Accept GitHub Organization Invitation\nBefore the conference, you’ll receive an invitation to join the openwashdata-conf GitHub organization.\n\nCheck your email for the invitation\nClick the invitation link\nAccept the invitation to join the organization\nVerify access at: github.com/openwashdata-conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t received an invitation by July 10, please contact the organizing team.",
